  ## Buckets
  - allows people to store objects (files) into buckets (directories)
  - buckets must have a globally unique name (accross all regons and all accounts)
  - defined at the region level
  - looks like a global service but buckets are created in a region
  - Nameing convention:
    - no uppercase
    - no underscore
    - 3-63 characters long
    - not an IP
    - must start with a lowercase letter or number
    - must NOT start with the prefix xn
    - must NOT end with the suffix s3alias
   
  ## Objects
  - objects have a key
  - the key is the Full path:
    - ex. s3://my-bucket/my-file.txt
  - the key is composed of the prefix + object name
    - ex. ex. s3://my-bucket/folder1/folder2/my-file.txt (folder1 and 2 are prefixes and the file is the object name)
  - S3 does not have a concept of directoris within buckets
  - keys are very long names that contain slashes (/)
  - object values are the content of the body:
    - max object size is 5TB (5000GB)
    - if uploading more than 5GB, must use the multi-part upload
  - objects can have metadata (list of key value pairs)
  - tags (unicode / value pair - up to 10). useful for security / lifecycle
  - Version ID (if versioning is enabled)
