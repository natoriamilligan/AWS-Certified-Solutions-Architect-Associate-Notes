# Getting Started
  ## Regions
  - regions are all over the world
  - a region is a cluster of data centers
  - each region is named
  - most AWS services are region-scoped
  **How to choose an AWS Region?**
    - compliance : data governance and legal requirements
    - proximity : to customers to reduce latency
    - available services : new features and new services aren't available in every region
    - pricing : pricing varies region to region
  ## Availibility Zones
  - each region has many availabilty zones (min usually 3 max is 6)
  - each AZ has one or more discrete data centers with redundant power networking and connectivity
  - they are separate from each other (disasters)
  - they are connected to the other AZ'z in the region (high bandwidth, and low latency)
